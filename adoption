                    have a specific protein taste receptor that makes them less responsive to sweet flavors compared to humans.Dogs are incredibly social animals, often forming close bonds not only with humans but also with other animals. This social
                    nature is deeply ingrained in their behavior, stemming from their ancestry as pack animals.

                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp Pet owners are mandated to provide their pets adequate care and sustenance. Second, pet owners are vicariously liable for the damage and harm caused by their pets. Key to being a responsible pet owner is to be mindful of these concepts, especially
                    because the cruel treatment of animals is punished as an offense.situation for dogs and cats varies from culture to culture. In some places, they are treated well, given scraps, even considered part of a family, though some may still
                    remain outdoors and roam the streets. Sometimes they serve to guard property or control pests but are unlikely to receive veterinary care or concern for their welfare. In other communities, they are disliked, or even feared, and may
                    be kicked, hit or stoned if they come too close.
